Project B - Metro Madness

A java program that simulates a basic model of the Melbourne train system.
The program incorporates elements including passengers, stations and train types, and renders using the gdx library.

As part of this assignment, an incomplete program was provided and the major functionalities had to be designed, incorporated and tested. The principle of this assignment was to not only gather understanding about object oriented coding practices, but to foremost apply the halmarks of good software design and development; UML diagrams were constructed as a means to assert the establishment of a bespoke architecture that facilitates appropriate object calls, functionality and abstraction. 

The program was implemented with the mission of demonstrating:
* Modularity
* Encapsulation
* Low coupling & High cohesiveness
* Abstract type solutions
* Polymorphism application
* Classes and Object Oriented design
